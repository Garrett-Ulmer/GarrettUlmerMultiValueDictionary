# App Overview

This app provides a working sample of a multivalue dictionary. It extends the funcionality of a generic dictionary by allowing for more than one value to be associated with each key in the dictionary.

It is recommended to open this project in Visual Studio, and open the .sln file in the GarrettUlmerMultiValueDictionary folder. This will allow the user to run the app as well as the associated unit tests.
